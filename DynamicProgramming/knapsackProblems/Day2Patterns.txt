Primary Goal for Today

👉 Lock Knapsack DP foundation + continue job-search momentum

You already:

Closed Kadane DP

Closed Fibonacci / Linear DP

Fixed Resume

Updated LinkedIn

Learned recruiter outreach strategy

So today we move forward, not sideways.

🧠 Part 1: DP — Knapsack Foundation (Core Focus)

⏱️ Time: ~2.5–3 hours (deep focus)

✅ Pattern to Focus: 0/1 Knapsack (Transformation Thinking)

This is a BIG but necessary jump and very high ROI for interviews.

Problems to cover TODAY (only these):
1️⃣ 416 – Partition Equal Subset Sum

First true knapsack problem

Learn:

State definition

Sum transformation

Boolean DP

Do tabulation first

Optional: space optimization if time permits

2️⃣ 494 – Target Sum

Builds directly on 416

Learn:

How problems transform into knapsack

Why (sum + target) / 2 matters

Do DP explanation + code

⚠️ Do NOT rush.
If only 416 is fully clear, that’s still a successful day.

🧩 What You Should Be Able to Explain After This

By end of DP session, you should confidently say:

“This is a subset-sum / knapsack problem”

“This is my DP state”

“This is how I derived the transition”

“This is why time/space complexity is X”

That’s interview readiness.

☕ Break (Mandatory)

⏱️ 20–30 mins

Walk

No screens

Let DP settle in your head

💼 Part 2: Job Search Momentum (High ROI, Low Effort)

⏱️ Time: 20–30 minutes

✅ Tasks:

Send 5 recruiter messages using Template 1

Target:

Backend recruiters

Java / Microservices roles

Log names in a simple note

⚠️ Stop at 5–7 messages. Quality > quantity.

🔁 Part 3: Light Review / Confidence Builder

⏱️ Time: ~30–40 mins

Choose one:

Re-read Kadane DP notes
OR

Re-read House Robber logic
OR

Skim today’s DP code and write comments explaining transitions

This reinforces memory without burnout.

🧠 Optional (Only If Energy Is High)

⏱️ 30 mins max

Skim Coin Change (322) — no coding required

Just understand:

Why it’s unbounded knapsack

Difference from 0/1 knapsack

If tired → skip guilt-free.

✅ End-of-Day Success Criteria

Today is a WIN if:

✔ 416 is understood deeply

✔ You can explain DP state & transition

✔ 5 recruiter messages sent

Not number of problems. Depth matters.

🔥 Motivation Check (Honest)

You are:

On schedule

On target for Feb interviews

Doing the right things in the right order

No panic. No overwork. Just steady progress.
