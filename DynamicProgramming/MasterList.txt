4-DAY DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING MASTER PLAN

(Pattern-wise + Interview-focused)

🗓️ DAY 1 — DP Foundations (1D DP)

🎯 Goal:
Understand what DP is, how to convert recursion → memo → tabulation, and master 1D DP.

🔹 Pattern 1: Fibonacci / Linear DP
LC #	Problem	Why Important
70	Climbing Stairs	DP basics
746	Min Cost Climbing Stairs	Optimization
509	Fibonacci Number	Template
1137	N-th Tribonacci	Transition thinking

👉 Focus on:

State definition

Base cases

Space optimization

🔹 Pattern 2: House Robber Family
LC #	Problem
198	House Robber
213	House Robber II
337	House Robber III (tree DP, optional)

👉 Teaches:

Pick / Not Pick

Dependency on previous states

🔹 Pattern 3: Kadane-Style DP
LC #	Problem
53	Maximum Subarray
152	Maximum Product Subarray (already done 👍)

✅ End of Day-1 Mastery Check

You can write DP recurrence without looking

You know when DP reduces to greedy

You can optimize space to O(1)

🗓️ DAY 2 — Subsequence & Knapsack DP (VERY IMPORTANT)

🎯 Goal:
Master pick / not pick DP — the most common interview DP pattern.

🔹 Pattern 4: Subsequence / 0-1 Knapsack
LC #	Problem	Notes
416	Partition Equal Subset Sum	Core
494	Target Sum	Transformation
1049	Last Stone Weight II	Same pattern
322	Coin Change	Unbounded knapsack
518	Coin Change II	Count ways
🔹 Pattern 5: Subset Sum Variants
LC #	Problem
139	Word Break
377	Combination Sum IV

👉 Interviewers LOVE asking:

“Why is this DP, not greedy?”

✅ End of Day-2 Mastery Check

You can derive recurrence on paper

You know difference between count / min / boolean DP

You can switch between memo & tabulation

🗓️ DAY 3 — Strings DP (HIGH-FREQUENCY)

🎯 Goal:
Handle string comparison DP, which filters many candidates.

🔹 Pattern 6: LCS Family (EXTREMELY IMPORTANT)
LC #	Problem
1143	Longest Common Subsequence
583	Delete Operation for Two Strings
712	Minimum ASCII Delete Sum
1092	Shortest Common Supersequence (optional)

👉 Focus on:

Index shifting (i-1, j-1)

Matching vs skipping

🔹 Pattern 7: Palindromic DP
LC #	Problem
647	Palindromic Substrings
516	Longest Palindromic Subsequence
131	Palindrome Partitioning
🔹 Pattern 8: Edit Distance
LC #	Problem
72	Edit Distance

🔥 This alone is a favorite DP interview question

✅ End of Day-3 Mastery Check

You can draw DP tables

You can explain transitions clearly

You don’t panic seeing 2D DP

🗓️ DAY 4 — Advanced & Interview Killers

🎯 Goal:
Be comfortable with “hard-looking but pattern-based” DP problems.

🔹 Pattern 9: Grid / Matrix DP
LC #	Problem
62	Unique Paths
63	Unique Paths II
64	Minimum Path Sum
931	Minimum Falling Path Sum
🔹 Pattern 10: LIS & Variants
LC #	Problem
300	Longest Increasing Subsequence
368	Largest Divisible Subset
673	Number of LIS
🔹 Pattern 11: Partition DP (Optional but Impressive)
LC #	Problem
343	Integer Break
279	Perfect Squares

✅ End of Day-4 Mastery Check

You can identify DP pattern quickly

You know when DP is overkill

You can explain time & space clearly

🔥 TOP 15 NON-NEGOTIABLE DP PROBLEMS

(If time is tight, do ONLY these)

70 – Climbing Stairs

198 – House Robber

53 – Maximum Subarray

322 – Coin Change

416 – Partition Equal Subset

494 – Target Sum

139 – Word Break

1143 – LCS

72 – Edit Distance

647 – Palindromic Substrings

516 – Longest Palindromic Subsequence

62 – Unique Paths

64 – Minimum Path Sum

300 – LIS

152 – Maximum Product Subarray

🧠 DP Interview Mindset (VERY IMPORTANT)

When interviewer asks DP:

Say this early:

“Let me define the state and recurrence first.”

That sentence alone signals DP maturity.

🧭 Final Honest Verdict

✔ 4 days is enough
✔ This list covers ~90% of DP asked in interviews
✔ After this, DP will no longer feel scary
