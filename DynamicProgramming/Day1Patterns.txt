PATTERN 1: Linear DP / Fibonacci Pattern

“DP where the answer at i depends on a small fixed window behind it.”

🧠 Core Idea

State:

dp[i] = answer for size i


Transition (generic):

dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]   (or min/max variation)

🔑 Problems to Do TODAY

Do them in this exact order:

1️⃣ 509 – Fibonacci Number
👉 Purpose: understand state & transition
👉 Do:

Recursion → Memo → Tabulation → Space optimized

2️⃣ 70 – Climbing Stairs
👉 Same pattern, real problem
👉 Interview classic

3️⃣ 746 – Min Cost Climbing Stairs
👉 Introduces min instead of sum

🧠 What You MUST Understand Before Moving On

Why recursion is slow

How memo avoids recomputation

How tabulation flips recursion

How space optimization works

If you can explain this sentence, you’re good:

“I only need the last two states, so I don’t need the full dp array.”

✅ PATTERN 2: House Robber Pattern (Decision DP)

“At every index, I must choose or skip.”

This is one of the most important DP patterns ever.

🧠 Core Idea

State:

dp[i] = max money till index i


Transition:

dp[i] = max(
    dp[i-1],          // skip current
    nums[i] + dp[i-2] // take current
)

🔑 Problems to Do TODAY

1️⃣ 198 – House Robber
👉 Absolute must-know
👉 Solve:

dp array

space optimized version

2️⃣ 213 – House Robber II
👉 Circular constraint
👉 Trick: solve twice

[0..n-2] and [1..n-1]


(Do not do HR-III today — that’s Tree DP, different mental mode.)

🧠 What You MUST Understand

Why greedy fails

Why local max ≠ global max

Why i-2 matters

Why circular breaks normal DP

If you can say:

“I transform the circular problem into two linear DP problems.”

You’re interview-ready.

⏱️ Time Plan (Very Realistic)

Pattern 1 → 1.5 hrs

Break → 10–15 min

Pattern 2 → 1.5 hrs

Final recap → 10 min

Total: ~3.5 hours (perfect for a deep DP day)

🚫 What NOT to Do Today

❌ Don’t jump to Knapsack
❌ Don’t do LCS today
❌ Don’t open too many problems
❌ Don’t memorize formulas

Today is about intuition, not breadth.

🧠 End-of-Day Self-Check (IMPORTANT)

Before you stop today, answer these out loud:

What is my state definition?

What are my choices?

What is my transition?

What is my base case?

Can I optimize space?

If you can answer these → today is a win.

✅ Summary (Lock This In)

Today you focus on:

✔ Linear DP (Fibonacci)

✔ Decision DP (House Robber)

These two alone cover 30–40% of DP interview questions.
