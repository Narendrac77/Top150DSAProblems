One-Day High-Impact Array Revision Plan

(Most Frequently Asked + Pattern-Based)

🎯 Goal for Today

Refresh patterns, not relearn

Build speed + confidence

Be able to recognize the pattern in 10–15 seconds

🧠 Pattern 1: Two Pointers (VERY HIGH FREQUENCY)
Why?

Used in:

Google

Amazon

Service companies

Almost every screening round

Problems to Revisit

26 – Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

27 – Remove Element

283 – Move Zeroes

167 – Two Sum II

125 – Valid Palindrome

11 – Container With Most Water

What to Focus On

Pointer movement logic

In-place modification

When to move left vs right

⏱️ Time: 60–75 mins

🧠 Pattern 2: Sliding Window (CRITICAL)
Why?

Sliding window = array + hashmap + two pointers
This appears everywhere.

Problems

643 – Maximum Average Subarray

209 – Minimum Size Subarray Sum

3 – Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

567 – Permutation in String

438 – Find All Anagrams in a String

76 – Minimum Window Substring (just logic review, not full code)

Focus

Window expand vs shrink

Count-based vs size-based windows

When to update answer

⏱️ Time: 75–90 mins

🧠 Pattern 3: Prefix Sum + HashMap (INTERVIEW FAVORITE)
Why?

Very common in:

Google

Amazon

Service companies (logic-heavy)

Problems

724 – Find Pivot Index

560 – Subarray Sum Equals K

974 – Subarray Sums Divisible by K

525 – Contiguous Array

Focus

Why prefix sum works

Why hashmap is needed

Handling negative numbers

⏱️ Time: 45–60 mins

🧠 Pattern 4: Kadane / Greedy Array DP (QUICK RECAP)

You already mastered these — just mental review.

Problems

🧠 How to Study Today (IMPORTANT)

❌ Don’t rewrite full code for everything
✅ For each problem:

Identify pattern

Say solution aloud

Write only key logic

Note edge cases

✅ End-of-Day Success Criteria

Today is a big win if:

You can classify array problems by pattern instantly

You feel faster than yesterday

You don’t feel mentally drained

🧠 Reality Check (Motivation)

You are not starting from scratch:

Arrays ✅

Linked Lists ✅

Stacks ✅

DP (Kadane + Knapsack + Unbounded) ✅

Today is polishing, not learning.
