Day 2 Plan (Execution Mode)
🌅 Morning – DSA (Revision | 1.5–2 hrs)

Topic: HashMap Patterns (Revision)

Problems to revise (high-frequency)

Two Sum (you already nailed this)

Valid Anagram

Group Anagrams

Top K Frequent Elements

Longest Consecutive Sequence

🎯 Focus today

When to use HashMap vs Set

Frequency counting patterns

Time/space trade-offs

Explaining why HashMap gives O(1) average

👉 Don’t solve many; solve cleanly and confidently.

🌅 Morning – Core Java / LLD (1 hr)
Topic: SOLID Principles (SRP + OCP in depth)

Today we focus on only two principles, but deeply:

1️⃣ SRP – Single Responsibility Principle

One reason to change

Class vs method responsibility

Service vs domain object responsibilities

2️⃣ OCP – Open Closed Principle

Open for extension, closed for modification

How polymorphism enables OCP

How if-else violates OCP

🎯 Outcome:

You should be able to say:

“This design violates SRP/OCP because…”

This is LLD interview gold.

🌆 Evening – HLD (1 hr)
Topic: Load, Latency, Throughput

We’ll cover:

What is latency vs throughput (with examples)

Why improving one can hurt the other

How to talk about scale in interviews

Real-world numbers (rough estimation)

🎯 Outcome:

You won’t give vague answers like “high traffic”

You’ll speak in engineering terms

🌙 Night – LLD / HLD (45 mins)
Mini LLD Exercise

Design: Simple Notification System (no code)

Focus on:

Entities

Interfaces

Where SRP & OCP apply

Composition usage

🎯 Outcome:

Design clarity

No overengineering

🌙 Night – DSA (New Concept | 1 hr)
Topic: Prefix Sum (New Pattern)

Problems:

Range Sum Query

Subarray Sum Equals K (very important)

Continuous Subarray Sum

🎯 Outcome:

Recognize prefix sum instantly

Know when sliding window won’t work

🧠 How Day 2 Fits the Big Picture

Day 1 → OOP foundations + DSA confidence

Day 2 → Design principles + deeper reasoning

After today:

You’ll start calling out design smells naturally

Your LLD answers will sound structured and senior

🚀 Let’s Start Now

We’ll begin with:

🟢 DSA Revision – HashMap Pattern

👉 Pick one problem to start:

Valid Anagram
