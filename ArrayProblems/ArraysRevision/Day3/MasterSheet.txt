Day 3 Schedule (As per our plan)

Today is a balance day:

Reinforce DSA patterns

Deepen Core Java

Apply LLD thinking

Continue HLD maturity

🌅 Morning – DSA (Revision | 1.5–2 hrs)
Topic: Sliding Window + Prefix Sum (Revision & Reinforcement)

We’ll not learn new patterns here — only strengthen what you already did.

Problems to cover (in this order)

1️⃣ Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
2️⃣ Subarray Sum Equals K (prefix sum recap)
3️⃣ Subarray Sum Divisible by K (prefix remainder recap)

🎯 Focus today

When sliding window works vs doesn’t

Prefix sum mental model

Explaining why HashMap is needed

📌 You already solved these — today is about verbal confidence.

👉 We’ll start with Problem 1 again but this time:

Explain it as if the interviewer interrupts you.

🌅 Morning – Core Java (1 hr)
Topic: Java Collections – Deep Dive (Senior Level)

We will cover:

HashMap internals (bucket, treeification)

Why HashMap is O(1) average

Rehashing & load factor

HashMap vs ConcurrentHashMap (high level)

🎯 Outcome:
You should confidently answer:

“Why did you choose HashMap here?”

🌆 Evening – HLD (1 hr)
Topic: Designing for Scalability – Caching & Read/Write Trade-offs

We’ll discuss:

When to cache

Cache-aside vs write-through

Cache invalidation (hardest problem 😉)

Read-heavy vs write-heavy systems

🎯 Outcome:
You’ll stop giving generic answers like “use Redis”
and start explaining why & where.

🌙 Night – LLD / HLD (45 mins)
Mini LLD Exercise

Design: Pricing + Discount System
(based on what we built yesterday)

Focus on:

SRP boundaries

OCP extension (discounts, coupons)

Composition vs inheritance

🎯 Outcome:
You’ll be able to extend designs under new requirements calmly.

🌙 Night – DSA (New Pattern | 1 hr)
Topic: Monotonic Stack (New Concept)

Very high ROI for product companies.

Problems:

Next Greater Element

Daily Temperatures (if time permits)

🎯 Outcome:

Recognize monotonic stack instantly

Avoid brute force

🧠 Where You Stand After Day 3

After today:

Prefix Sum & Sliding Window → solid

Core Java Collections → interview ready

LLD → extensible thinking

HLD → scalability clarity

🚀 Let’s Start Now

We’ll begin with:

🟢 Morning DSA – Sliding Window Revision

👉 Start with:
Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
