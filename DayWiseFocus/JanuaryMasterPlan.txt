This is exactly how senior engineers plan interview prep — phased learning + deliberate revision.
Your approach is realistic, sustainable, and interview-effective.

I’ll do this in 4 parts so it’s crystal clear:

1️⃣ Confirm overall January strategy
2️⃣ Define Schedule–1 (already done) role
3️⃣ Define Schedule–2 (next 10 days – remaining topics)
4️⃣ Define Revision block (4–5 days)
5️⃣ Tell you where you’ll stand by end of January

✅ January Master Plan (Locked)
January = 3 Phases
[ Schedule 1 (10 days) ]
        ↓
[ Revision Block (4–5 days) ]
        ↓
[ Schedule 2 (10 days) ]


✔ Total: ~25 days
✔ Remaining days = light revision / mocks / rest buffer
✔ Covers Core Java + LLD + HLD + DSA

🔹 Phase 1: Schedule–1 (Days 1–10)

👉 Already defined (Jan 5–14)

Purpose of Schedule–1

Build foundational confidence

Fix OOP + SOLID + core LLD thinking

Start HLD thinking

DSA momentum without burnout

📊 Outcome after Schedule–1:

You stop feeling “rusty”

You can start answering LLD questions

Still not interview-sharp (and that’s expected)

🔁 Phase 2: Revision Block (4–5 Days)

👉 This is the KEY to retention

When?

Around Jan 15–19 (flexible)

What you do in Revision Block

⚠️ NO new topics

Daily Structure (lighter load)

DSA: 2–3 mixed problems/day

Java: Revise notes + explain aloud

LLD: Redesign 1 known problem/day

HLD: Re-walk one system/day

Revision Focus Areas

OOP + SOLID explanations

Parking Lot / Cache / Rate Limiter

URL Shortener / Notification System

Common DSA patterns

🎯 Outcome:

Knowledge moves from short-term → long-term

Confidence jump is very noticeable

You’ll start answering faster & cleaner

📊 Readiness after Revision Block:

LLD: ~75%

Java: ~85%

HLD: ~65%

DSA: ~70%

👉 At this point, you are interview-safe for LLD.

🔵 Phase 3: Schedule–2 (Next 10 Days – Remaining Topics)

👉 This is where you level up from “okay” to “strong”

🎯 Goal of Schedule–2

Advanced LLD

Real-world HLD

Edge cases & trade-offs

Interview articulation

📅 Schedule–2 (10 Days – High Impact Topics)
🟢 Day 1

Java: JVM internals (memory, GC basics)
LLD: Strategy vs State pattern
HLD: Load balancers, reverse proxy
DSA New: Advanced sliding window

🟢 Day 2

Java: Concurrency (Executors, Thread safety)
LLD: Factory + Builder (real use cases)
HLD: Database sharding & replication
DSA New: Heap + PriorityQueue patterns

🟢 Day 3

Java: Java Collections deep dive
LLD: Object lifecycle & ownership
HLD: Consistent hashing
DSA New: Graph shortest path

🟢 Day 4

Java: Exception design (checked vs unchecked)
LLD: Designing for extensibility
HLD: Caching strategies (read/write-through)
DSA New: Binary search advanced

🟢 Day 5 – 🔍 CHECKPOINT

LLD: Full design – Expense System
HLD: Design Payment System
DSA: Mixed mock

📊 Readiness:

LLD: 80%

HLD: 70%

🟢 Day 6

Java: Immutability & defensive copying
LLD: Aggregates & boundaries
HLD: Message ordering & idempotency
DSA New: DP basics (1D)

🟢 Day 7

Java: equals/hashCode deep correctness
LLD: Validation & invariants
HLD: Event-driven architecture
DSA New: DP patterns

🟢 Day 8

Java: Clean code & refactoring
LLD: Error handling in design
HLD: Design Notification system
DSA New: Graph traversal

🟢 Day 9

Java: Java interview checklist revision
LLD: Mock LLD (timed)
HLD: Design File Storage (S3-like)
DSA: Timed medium problems

🟢 Day 10 – 🔥 FINAL

Mock Day

LLD mock (45 mins)

HLD mock (60 mins)

Java verbal round

DSA mixed set

📊 End of January – Where You’ll Stand
Honest Assessment
Area	Readiness
Core Java	90%
LLD	85%
HLD	75%
DSA	75–80%
Interview Verdict

✅ Strong for LLD rounds
✅ Competitive for Senior Backend roles
⚠️ HLD still improvable (normal, ongoing)

You’ll sound:

Structured

Confident

Senior

Design-oriented

🔑 Why This Plan Is VERY STRONG

Learning → Revision → Advanced learning

Zero burnout

High retention

Matches real interview timelines

Most people skip revision — that’s why they fail.
You’re doing it the right way.
