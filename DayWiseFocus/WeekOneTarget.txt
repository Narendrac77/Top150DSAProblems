Exact day-by-day plan (10 days)
2️⃣ Daily deliverables (what “done” means)
3️⃣ Progress checkpoints (Day 5 & Day 10)
4️⃣ Where you’ll stand on the interview readiness scale

This is tailored to your experience (7+ years) and LLD/HLD-heavy product company interviews.

🔒 Fixed Daily Time Split (as agreed)

DSA (Revision – Morning): 1.5–2 hrs

Core Java / LLD (Morning): 1 hr

HLD (Evening): 1 hr

LLD/HLD (Night): 45 mins

DSA (New Concept – Night): 1 hr

⚠️ No changes to time. Only topics evolve.

📅 10-Day Plan (5 Jan – 14 Jan)
🟢 DAY 1 – Foundations (5 Jan)

DSA Revision: Arrays, Two Pointers
DSA New: Sliding Window
Core Java / LLD: OOP principles (Abstraction, Encapsulation, Composition)
HLD: How to approach any system design
LLD Night: Identify entities & responsibilities (Notification system)

🎯 Outcome:

OOP explanations are interview-safe

You can explain how you think, not jump to design

🟢 DAY 2

DSA Revision: HashMap patterns
DSA New: Prefix Sum
Core Java / LLD: SOLID principles (SRP, OCP deep dive)
HLD: Load, latency, throughput, availability
LLD Night: Refactor bad design → SOLID-compliant

🎯 Outcome:

You start spotting design smells

Can say “this violates SRP/OCP”

🟢 DAY 3

DSA Revision: Stack & Queue
DSA New: Monotonic Stack
Core Java / LLD: Interface vs Abstract Class
HLD: CAP theorem + consistency models
LLD Night: Parking Lot – entity modeling only

🎯 Outcome:

Confident Java design decisions

LLD structure forming naturally

🟢 DAY 4

DSA Revision: Binary Search patterns
DSA New: Binary Search on Answer
Core Java / LLD: Immutability & Value Objects
HLD: Database basics (SQL vs NoSQL, indexing)
LLD Night: Parking Lot – class responsibilities

🎯 Outcome:

Cleaner Java modeling

Parking Lot half-designed mentally

🟢 DAY 5 – 🔍 CHECKPOINT 1

DSA Revision: Trees (DFS/BFS)
DSA New: Tree recursion patterns
Core Java / LLD: Exception handling design
HLD: API design & REST fundamentals
LLD Night: Parking Lot – end-to-end walkthrough

🔎 Self-Assessment (Day 5)

You should be able to:

Design Parking Lot without panic

Explain SOLID with examples

Solve medium DSA without hints

📊 Readiness Level:

DSA: 55–60%

Core Java: 70%

LLD: 55%

HLD: 45%

👉 Mid-level → Senior transition has started

🟢 DAY 6

DSA Revision: Linked List
DSA New: Fast & Slow pointer
Core Java / LLD: Equals & hashCode (design correctness)
HLD: Caching (Redis use-cases, eviction)
LLD Night: Design Cache (LLD)

🎯 Outcome:

Strong correctness mindset

Cache design usable in interviews

🟢 DAY 7

DSA Revision: Heaps
DSA New: Top-K patterns
Core Java / LLD: Concurrency basics (locks, immutability)
HLD: Message queues & async processing
LLD Night: Rate Limiter (LLD)

🎯 Outcome:

Thread-safety awareness

Can design rate limiter confidently

🟢 DAY 8

DSA Revision: Graph basics
DSA New: BFS/DFS templates
Core Java / LLD: Design Patterns (Strategy, Decorator)
HLD: Microservices basics
LLD Night: Payment system (composition-heavy)

🎯 Outcome:

Pattern-driven thinking

Excellent answers to “why composition?”

🟢 DAY 9

DSA Revision: Recursion & Backtracking
DSA New: Subsets / permutations
Core Java / LLD: Builder & Factory patterns
HLD: System design – URL shortener
LLD Night: Expense system (very relevant to you)

🎯 Outcome:

Real-world design articulation improves

Confidence increases sharply

🟢 DAY 10 – 🔥 FINAL CHECKPOINT

DSA Revision: Mixed problems (mock)
DSA New: Revision only
Core Java / LLD: Java interview checklist
HLD: End-to-end mock system design
LLD Night: Mock LLD interview (self-driven)

📊 FINAL ASSESSMENT – Where You’ll Stand
After 10 Days:
Area	Readiness
DSA	65–70%
Core Java	80%
LLD	70%
HLD	60%
Interview Readiness Verdict:

✅ Ready for LLD rounds
⚠️ HLD needs more practice (normal)
✅ Strong Java + design articulation

👉 You’ll be interviewable, not perfect — and that’s OK.

🎯 What This Means Practically

You can confidently start applying

You won’t freeze in LLD rounds

You can defend design decisions

You sound like a Senior Engineer, not a coder

🔜 After These 10 Days

Next phase (Weeks 3–6):

Full mock interviews

HLD deep dives

Advanced LLD problems
