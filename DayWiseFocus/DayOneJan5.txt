Confirmed Daily Schedule (Locked)
🌅 Morning

1️⃣ DSA – Revision (1.5 to 2 hrs)

Revise already-known patterns

Focus on speed + correctness

No new learning here

2️⃣ Core Java / LLD – 1 hr

Java fundamentals from design perspective

OOP, immutability, concurrency basics

🌆 Evening

3️⃣ HLD – 1 hr

System design fundamentals

Real-world scalable systems

Trade-offs, bottlenecks

🌙 Night

4️⃣ LLD / HLD – 45 mins

Apply concepts

UML / class design / flow diagrams

Mock interview thinking

5️⃣ DSA – New Concept / Pattern (1 hr)

One new pattern only

Implement + understand use-cases

👉 This split is excellent because:

DSA = muscle memory

Java/LLD/HLD = thinking & articulation

📅 Day 1 Plan – Sunday, 5th Jan
🟢 Morning – DSA (Revision)

Topic: Arrays + Two Pointers (Revision)

Revise:

Two Sum

Container With Most Water

Move Zeros

Remove Duplicates (sorted array)

🎯 Goal:

90% accuracy

Clean edge-case handling

Time/space explanation

🟢 Morning – Core Java / LLD (1 hr)

Topic:

Java OOP from LLD perspective

Abstraction vs Encapsulation (interview framing)

Why composition over inheritance

Interface vs abstract class (when & why)

✔ Deliverable:

Be able to verbally explain

One clean example in your head (Payment / Notification)

🟢 Evening – HLD (1 hr)

Topic:

HLD Fundamentals – How to Think

Functional vs Non-functional requirements

Scalability basics

Latency vs throughput

Vertical vs horizontal scaling

✔ Deliverable:

Explain how to approach any HLD question

No diagrams yet, only thinking framework

🟢 Night – LLD / HLD (45 mins)

Topic:

LLD Thinking Exercise

Identify entities

Identify behaviors

Identify what changes frequently

Example:

Design a simple Notification System (no coding)

Just class names + responsibilities.

🟢 Night – DSA (New Concept – 1 hr)

Topic:

Sliding Window (New Pattern)

Fixed window vs variable window

Problems:

Max sum subarray of size k

Longest substring without repeating chars

🎯 Goal:

Recognize pattern instantly

No memorization, only intuition

🧠 Why This Plan Will Work for You

Because:

You already know Java

You already know DSA

Now you’re training design thinking + articulation

This is exactly what Tier-1 product companies expect at your level.

🔒 Ground Rules (Very Important)

No over-learning on Day 1

Consistency > Intensity

Speak answers out loud (LLD/HLD)

One notebook / doc for:

LLD patterns

HLD frameworks

Common interview answers

Tomorrow night, after Day 1, we’ll:

Review what worked

Adjust pacing if needed
