REES — 2-DAY MASTER SHEET (Interview-Focused)
🗓️ DAY 1 — Tree Traversals & Core Patterns (FOUNDATION)

🎯 Goal:
Become fluent with recursion, DFS, BFS, and basic tree reasoning.

🔹 Pattern 1: Tree Traversals (MUST KNOW)
LC #	Problem	Pattern
144	Binary Tree Preorder Traversal	DFS
94	Binary Tree Inorder Traversal	DFS
145	Binary Tree Postorder Traversal	DFS
102	Binary Tree Level Order Traversal	BFS
107	Level Order Traversal II	BFS
199	Binary Tree Right Side View	BFS

👉 Focus on:

Recursion base cases

Stack vs recursion

Queue usage in BFS

🔹 Pattern 2: Height / Depth / Balanced Trees
LC #	Problem
104	Maximum Depth of Binary Tree
111	Minimum Depth of Binary Tree
110	Balanced Binary Tree

🎯 These teach:

Bottom-up recursion

Returning height + validity together

🔹 Pattern 3: Tree Comparison / Symmetry
LC #	Problem
100	Same Tree
101	Symmetric Tree
572	Subtree of Another Tree

👉 Interviewers use these to test:

Recursive correctness

Structure + value comparison

🔹 Pattern 4: Path-Based Problems (ENTRY LEVEL)
LC #	Problem
112	Path Sum
113	Path Sum II
✅ End of Day-1 Mastery Check

You should be able to:

Write DFS recursion without hesitation

Explain preorder / inorder / postorder

Handle null nodes confidently

Decide BFS vs DFS instinctively

🗓️ DAY 2 — Advanced Tree Patterns (INTERVIEW KILLERS)

🎯 Goal:
Handle real interview questions that separate average vs strong candidates.

🔥 Pattern 5: Diameter / Maximum Path (VERY IMPORTANT)
LC #	Problem
543	Diameter of Binary Tree
124	Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum

👉 Core idea:

Postorder traversal

Return height / contribution upward

Maintain global answer

🔹 Pattern 6: Lowest Common Ancestor (EXTREMELY FREQUENT)
LC #	Problem
236	LCA of Binary Tree
235	LCA of BST

🎯 Interview favorite:

“Explain why this works.”

🔹 Pattern 7: Tree Construction
LC #	Problem
105	Construct Tree from Preorder + Inorder
106	Construct Tree from Inorder + Postorder

👉 Tests:

Index mapping

Recursive slicing logic

🔹 Pattern 8: BST Properties
LC #	Problem
98	Validate Binary Search Tree
700	Search in a BST
701	Insert into a BST
🔹 Pattern 9: Views & Vertical Traversal
LC #	Problem
103	Zigzag Level Order
987	Vertical Order Traversal (advanced)
🔹 Pattern 10: Tree DP (LIGHT INTRO)
LC #	Problem
337	House Robber III
968	Binary Tree Cameras (optional, hard)
✅ End of Day-2 Mastery Check

You should be able to:

Explain why postorder is used

Write LCA logic cleanly

Solve diameter/path problems confidently

Combine multiple values in recursion

🧠 Tree Problem Recognition Cheat Sheet
Question Mentions	Think
Height / depth	DFS
Level-wise	BFS
Path / diameter	Postorder
Ancestor	LCA
BST	Bounds / inorder
“Maximum”	Global variable
Two children results	Postorder
🎯 Interview One-Liners (VERY IMPORTANT)

Traversal:

“I’ll solve this using DFS recursion.”

Diameter / Max Path:

“I use postorder to compute height and update a global result.”

LCA:

“If the current node matches either target, return it upward.”

These lines signal tree mastery.
